# Alarm-clock-with-GUI
An alarm clock with a GUI is a program that allows the user to set an alarm and display it on a graphical user interface. The GUI will typically have a clock face, which displays the current time, and buttons or other interactive elements that allow the user to set the alarm time and enable or disable the alarm

Choose a GUI library: Python has several libraries for creating graphical user interfaces, such as Tkinter, PyQt, wxPython, and PyGTK. You'll need to choose one of these libraries to create your alarm clock.

Design the GUI: Once you've chosen a GUI library, you'll need to design the interface for your alarm clock. This could include a clock face, buttons or drop-down menus to set the alarm time, and a message or sound to indicate when the alarm has gone off.

Create the backend logic: You'll need to write Python code to handle the alarm clock's functionality, such as updating the clock face, setting the alarm time, and triggering the alarm.

Connect the GUI to the backend logic: You'll need to link the GUI elements to the appropriate Python code so that the user's interactions with the GUI (e.g. setting the alarm time) trigger the appropriate actions in the backend logic.

Test and refine: Finally, you'll need to test your alarm clock and refine the GUI and backend logic as needed to make it work smoothly.
